** TODO image channels?

* TODO [#B] "distribution abstractions"

* TODO how should we handle partially included spots in an image patch?
  note that the data assumes that we predict expression values over the entire spot.
  right now, the network needs to overpredict expression on the visible area.

  - one possibility is to simply drop spots that aren't fully contained in the image patch.
  - we could also interpolate new expression values.
    the problem with that is that the visible part of the patch may have an entirely different expression vector.

* TODO [#A] factorize after summing inside spots

* TODO [#B] data augmentation

* TODO [#B] multiple datasets

* TODO [#C] try out different image likelihoods
  for example,

  - channel covariance
  - spatial covariance
