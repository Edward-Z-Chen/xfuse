* DONE how should we handle partially included spots in an image patch?
  CLOSED: [2019-02-28 Thu 18:05]
  note that the data assumes that we predict expression values over the entire spot.
  right now, the network needs to overpredict expression on the visible area.

  - one possibility is to simply drop spots that aren't fully contained in the image patch.
  - we could also interpolate new expression values.
    the problem with that is that the visible part of the patch may have an entirely different expression vector.

* TODO [#A] factorize after summing inside spots
  can we even get the factorization working? :/
  if it is working in std, there is no reason why it wouldn't work here?

* TODO [#B] data augmentation

* TODO [#B] multiple datasets

* TODO [#C] try out different image likelihoods
  for example,

  - channel covariance
  - spatial covariance

* DONE [#B] add batchnorms?
