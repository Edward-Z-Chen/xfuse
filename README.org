#+TITLE: XFuse: Deep spatial data fusion

[[https://github.com/ludvb/xfuse/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild+branch%3Amaster][https://github.com/ludvb/xfuse/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master]]

* Installing

  To install XFuse to your home directory, run
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pip install --user git+https://github.com/ludvb/xfuse@master
  #+END_SRC

* Hardware requirements

  XFuse can run on CPU-only hardware, but training new models will take exceedingly long.
  We recommend running XFuse on a GPU with at least 8 GB of VRAM.

* Usage

  Coming soon!
